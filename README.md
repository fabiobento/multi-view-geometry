# multi-view-geometry
Some scripts about stereo vision and how we can reconstruct the 3D map of a scene.

Topics involved includes:
- Epipolar geometry,
- Depth maps, and
- 3D reconstruction.

In short, the objective is practice how to extract 3D information from stereo images and build a point cloud.
